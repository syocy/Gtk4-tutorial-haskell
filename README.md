# Gtk4-tutorial-haskell

[English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

This repository is a learning project that attempts to translate sample code from the
[ToshioCP's GTK 4 tutorial](https://toshiocp.github.io/Gtk4-tutorial/)
into Haskell using
[haskell-gi](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi).

This project is intended for:

- People who are interested in how sample code from the [ToshioCP's GTK 4 tutorial](https://toshiocp.github.io/Gtk4-tutorial/) would be written in another language.
- People who are interested in developing GUI applications in Haskell.

Currently, this repository covers from Section 3 through 8.

This repository is a personal project and is not affiliated with ToshioCP, the GTK project, or the haskell-gi project.

## Intended Audience and Prerequisites

- Basic Knowledge of Haskell and cabal-based development
- An environment where GTK 4 applications can be executed
- Required packages and libraries for haskell-gi are installed
    - Please refer to the haskell-gi README for installation instructions: https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi?tab=readme-ov-file#readme

The author has tested code on Ubuntu running under Windows WSL2.

## Directory Structure

Under the `app/` directory, there are Haskell source files (`.hs`) corresponding to the sample code of each section in the GTK 4 tutorial.

Each Haskell file is designed to be as self-contained and directly executable as possible.
A corresponding executable is defined in the `.cabal` file for each source file.

Example:

- [`app/Sec04_2.hs`](app/Sec04_2.hs): Haskell code corresponding to the second executable unit in Section 4 of the GTK 4 tutorial 
- `sec04-2`: the executable name used to run the above code

## Build Instructions and Notes

In this project, it is recommended to build executables individually.

Since the `.cabal` file defines many executables, running `cabal build` without specifying a target may significantly increase disk usage.

Please specify the build target explicitly.

`cabal build`:

```shell
cabal build sec04-1
```

`cabal run` and checking the exit status:

```shell
cabal run sec04-1 ; echo $?      # bash
cabal run sec04-1 ; echo $status # fish
```

Alternatively, enabling dynamic linking may help reduce disk usage.  
(Please refer to the cabal documentation for the exact configuration method.)

```haskell
-- cabal.project.local
executable-dynamic: True
```

Or, as a somewhat legacy approach:

```shell
cabal configure --enable-executable-dynamic
```

## Note on the Use of Generative AI

To avoid misunderstandings, the scope of generative AI usage is clarified here.

In the development of this repository, generative AI is used exclusively for English translation and for answering technical questions.

No code generated by AI (so-called "vibe coding") is included.
